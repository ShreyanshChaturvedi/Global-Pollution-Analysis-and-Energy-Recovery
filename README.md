🌍 Global Pollution Analysis and Energy Recovery
📌 Objective
The aim of this project is to analyze global pollution data and build predictive models to:

Predict energy recovery from various pollution indicators.

Classify countries into pollution severity categories (Low, Medium, High).

Generate insights and recommendations for pollution control and sustainable energy recovery.

📁 Dataset
Name: Global_Pollution_Analysis.csv

Features include:
Air_Pollution_Index, Water_Pollution_Index, Soil_Pollution_Index,
Industrial_Waste (in tons), CO2_Emissions (in MT),
Energy_Recovered (in GWh), Renewable_Energy (%),
Country, Year, and more.

🚦 Project Phases
📊 Phase 1: Data Collection and EDA
✅ Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Imported dataset and handled missing values using imputation.

Normalized pollution indices.

Applied Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables.

✅ Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed descriptive statistics.

Used correlation heatmaps to study feature relationships.

Created bar charts, line plots, and box plots to visualize pollution trends across years and countries.

✅ Step 3: Feature Engineering
Extracted yearly pollution trends.

Created a new feature: Energy Consumption per Capita.

🤖 Phase 2: Predictive Modeling
🔹 Step 4: Linear Regression (Energy Recovery Prediction)
Model Goal: Predict Energy_Recovered (in GWh) based on pollution metrics.

Features Used: Air_Pollution_Index, CO2_Emissions, Industrial_Waste, etc.

Evaluation Metrics:

R² Score

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

🔹 Step 5: Logistic Regression (Pollution Severity Classification)
Model Goal: Classify countries into Low, Medium, and High pollution severity.

Features Used: Air_Pollution_Index, CO2_Emissions, etc.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

📈 Phase 3: Reporting and Insights
📌 Step 6: Model Evaluation
Compared both Linear and Logistic Regression models using evaluation metrics.

Visualized results using plots, reports, and confusion matrices.

💡 Step 7: Actionable Insights
Identified countries with high pollution but low energy recovery.

Provided recommendations:

Invest in renewable energy.

Strengthen industrial waste regulation.

Promote clean technology sharing between countries.
